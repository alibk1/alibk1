Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Ali Baran Korkmaz

Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a strong passion for
game development, particularly using the Unity game engine. My interest
in this field began in the 9th grade when I participated in the "Make
Tomorrow" competition, where my project was recognized among the top
50. That same year, I entered METU's "Anlat Robotunu" competition,
creating a game centered around a robot from my dreams, which earned
a place among the top 9 projects.
Additionally, I was invited to participate in the FATIH coding project
alongside my teacher and three peers. Over the course of three years, I
dedicated myself to mastering the Unity game engine and have been
actively utilizing it since September 2018. My primary focus has been on
developing games for the mobile platforms.
Lately, I have been dealing with Flutter for about 2 years and I have
developed more than 10 projects in this field. In addition, the KAVIS system
I developed for the use of public institutions was also developed with
Flutter.
I have expanded my skills to include Java, Python, C++, C, and PHP,
developing various projects with these languages at a basic to
intermediate level. This broad spectrum of knowledge has enabled me to
tackle diverse challenges and innovate in my projects.
Beyond my academic achievements, I have been working as a freelance
developer, creating applications and games with unique features in fields
such as Bluetooth, cryptocurrencies, VR - AR, and AI integrations. My
freelance work has allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios,
delivering impactful solutions to clients.
My journey in technology is characterized by a commitment to continuous
learning and adaptation. I have consistently sought out new challenges
and opportunities to expand my skill set and remain at the forefront of
technological advancements.
